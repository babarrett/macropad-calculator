## Design ideas

* Project inspired by G80-9009 built-in calculator and functions.
* Also drawing inspiration from the old HP 35/45 calculators for **RPN**, functions and color scheme.
* The "Paste" function key takes the current value and:
    * Pastes the numeric text into the data stream of the keyboard and onto the computer, and
    * exits Calculator mode.
* Expecting to hand-wire it, but TBD.
* For full matrix would need this I/O:
    * USB
    * 10 pins = 6 x 4 matrix
    * 4 pins for LCD display
    * LED for Calc mode on/off?
    * Power control for LCD on/off (save power and use as Calc mode indicator
    * Plus something to control contrast(?)

## Features
* Unary operators:
    1/x, âˆš, M+, M-, M store, M recall, CL X
* Binary operators:
    \+ -, *, /
* Others:
    x <==> y, rotate, Clear (all), Backspace, +/-, E EX, Paste, Enter
* Modes: Hex/Decimal would be nice.
* Stack (at least 3 level)
* Memory (up to 10 addressable). M Store + #, where # is from 0 to 9, stores X into that memory. M Recall, # likewise.
* M Recall repeated could scroll through the stored addresses

* Arduino [trivial calculator](http://www.microcontroller-project.com/calculator-with-pic16f877-microcontroller.html) with 16x2 screen
* [Full, scientific, RPN](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=388331.0)
Arduino calculator. Simple(?) to wire? 64 bit floating point, battery powered.
Two line, about 16 character, green (LED?) display. Small keys, Hex/Decimal
modes, compiled to 32K on a 328p so no room for a boot loader.
* [Arduino LDC + 16
keys](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/simple-arduino-based-calculator/). 
Breadboarded. Used an UNO and LCD1602A display. 4 x 4 (16) keys. Integer arithmetic.
