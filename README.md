## Design ideas

* Project inspired by G80-9009 built-in calculator and functions.
* Also drawing inspiration from the old HP 35/45 calculators for **RPN**, functions and color scheme.
* The "Paste" function key takes the current value and:
    * Pastes the numeric text into the data stream of the keyboard and onto the computer, and
    * exits Calculator mode.
* Expecting to hand-wire it.
* Geekhack [macropad project](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=85874.0) -- no display.
* Arduino [trivial calculator](http://www.microcontroller-project.com/calculator-with-pic16f877-microcontroller.html) with 16x2 screen
* [Quick Key Adapter, 10 Button
Keyboard](http://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-Key-Adapter-10-Button-HID-
Keyboard/) PIC18F14K50. Complete parts kit: $25.00 (sold out) Programable w/Modifier keys.
* For full matrix would need this I/O:
    * USB
    * 10 pins = 6 x 4 matrix
    * 4 pins for LCD display
    * LED for Calc mode on/off?
    * Power control for LCD on/off (save power and use as Calc mode indicator
    * Plus something to control contrast(?)

## Features

    1/x, âˆš, M+, M-, M store, M recall
